<h1 style="margin:0; padding-top:10px;">BOOKING & RESERVATION</h1>

<p>Dear guests, Our restaurant is open for lunch and dinner, Tuesday through Saturday. We accept reservations via an online system and phone. At the moment, reservations are open through the 20th of December (the restaurant will be closed for the holidays).</p>

<p>Restaurant Nausif's Restaurant will be closing for the winter holidays after dinner service on the 20th of December. We will be re-opening in Copenhagen on the 24th of March of 2015, after our trip to Japan.</p>

<p>For reservations beyond the 24th of March 2015, we will open our system according to the following schedule:</p>

<p>On Monday the 12th of January 2015 at 10 a.m. (CET), we begin accepting table reservations for the last week of March – starting from Tuesday the 24th of March – and the whole month of April 2015.</p>

<p>On Monday the 2nd of February 2015 at 10 a.m. (CET), we begin accepting table reservations for the month of May 2015.</p>

<p>Please be informed that we will not be able to accept bookings for these months via phone, as the whole team will be in Tokyo, Japan.

Nausif's Restaurant is closed on Sundays and Mondays.

Reservation for 1 – 8 people and shared tables</p>

<h2>Online booking</h2>

<p>Please visit the above link for bookings in the main dining room or for bookings on our shared table. You can also reach us by telephone at +45 3296 3297, Monday through Friday, from 10 a.m. to 3.00 p.m.

Waiting List: If your desired date is unavailable, we encourage you to enter your name on the online waiting list (via the same online booking system) for the dates that would be convenient. Tables often become available as the date nears, when some guests need to cancel their bookings.</p>

<p>Shared Table: We also offer guests a place on our shared table. Instead of having your own table in the dining room, you would be sharing this table with other guests.
Please note the terms and conditions for a reservation at the shared table: Reservations at the shared table include an aperitif, the Nausif's Restaurant menu, a juice or wine pairing, water, and tea/coffee. The rates for every aspect of the experience are the same as in the main dining room, but here they are sold together, as a package: DKK 2,900 for those that choose the wine pairing, DKK 2,400 for those that choose juice option. To book seats at the shared table, please choose the ‘shared table’ option in the dropdown menu after clicking the ‘online booking’ link above.</p>

<h2>Reservations in the private dining room</h2>

<p>booking@nausifrestaurant.pk

One floor above the main dining room, we have Nausif's Restaurant’s erstwhile staff room, which years ago was converted into a private dining room with beautiful views of the Copenhagen harbor. The room can accommodate up to 16 diners for lunch or dinner. We serve the same menu in the staff room as in the main dining room. When booking the private dining room, a minimum spend of DKK 25,000 applies. To book the room, please contact booking@nausifrestaurant.pk or call +45 3296 3297</p>

<h2>Bespoke</h2>

<p>For parties larger than 18 — or if you would like to hear about Nausif's Restaurant’s bespoke events for groups both large and small — please contact booking@nausifrestaurant.pk</p>

<h2>Existing reservations</h2>

Our lines are open on weekdays from 10.00 a.m to 3.00 pm. We look forward to welcoming you at Nausif's Restaurant.</p>
